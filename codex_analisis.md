Overview

  - Full-stack app: FastAPI backend + React/Vite frontend to generate marketing images via Gemini.
  - Backend handles upload/generation/auth; frontend has auth flow, upload UI, gallery, and axios interceptors.
  - Current repo contains valid uploads and generated folders with sample files; several config mismatches and critical security issues.

  Backend

  - App entry: backend/app/main.py:8 with CORS, static mounts, and routers.
  - Config: backend/app/core/config.py:7 defines env, directories, and CORS. It raises on missing Supabase config (backend/app/core/config.py:35).
  - Auth service: Supabase-based signup/login/reset (backend/app/services/auth.py).
  - File handling: Upload, generate, download, and metadata tracking (backend/app/routers/files.py, backend/app/services/file_manager.py, backend/app/services/image_generator.py).
  - Image generation: Uses google-genai with analysis prompt → dynamic prompts → parallel generation (backend/app/services/image_generator.py).

  Frontend

  - Base URL: axios defaults to VITE_API_BASE_URL (default http://127.0.0.1:8000) via frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx:52.
  - Auth: axios interceptors for Bearer and refresh token; Supabase Google OAuth redirect (frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx).
  - Upload flow: UploadSection calls uploadAndGenerateImages → /upload then /generate (frontend/src/components/UploadSection.tsx, frontend/src/lib/api.ts).
  - Generated image URLs normalized to absolute API URLs (frontend/src/lib/api.ts).

  Critical Security Issues

  - Unsigned JWT acceptance: verify_token decodes JWT with verify_signature=False (backend/app/services/auth.py:326). Anyone can forge a token with a sub and gain access.
      - Fix: Verify Supabase JWT signatures using JWKS or a known secret, e.g. jwt.decode(token, key=public_key, algorithms=["RS256"], audience=..., options={"verify_signature": True}). Use a JWKS client and cache keys.
  - Public static mounts bypass auth: Static files are served at /uploads and /generated directly (backend/app/main.py:20-21), bypassing router checks. If a URL is known, anyone can fetch.
      - Fix options:
          - Remove public app.mount for /generated and /uploads, and serve downloads only via authenticated endpoints.
          - Or gate static mounts behind an auth dependency using a custom AuthMiddleware or a proxy route; simplest is to remove mounts.
  - Secrets committed in repo: backend/.env and frontend/.env include real API keys and Supabase keys. These should not be committed. Keys must be rotated immediately.
      - Fix: Remove the files from VCS, add to .gitignore, and rotate/revoke keys in Google/Supabase.

  Functional/Config Mismatches

  - Readme vs reality:
      - README says no auth required and a simple MVP, but all file routes require auth (backend/app/routers/files.py:17, :53, :88, :105).
      - README run command says python main.py in backend, but actual entry is app.main:app. The helper backend/start.py runs "main:app" which doesn’t exist.
      - README ports: mentions frontend at 3000, backend expects frontend URL http://localhost:8081 (backend/app/core/config.py:32), Vite dev server is 8080 (frontend/vite.config.ts:9). Inconsistent.
  - Supabase hard requirement: Settings.__init__ raises if Supabase vars are missing (backend/app/core/config.py:35), blocking local runs that only need uploads/generation.
  - CORS overly permissive: ALLOWED_ORIGINS=["*"] with ALLOW_CREDENTIALS=False (backend/app/core/config.py:20-24). Broad but workable for Bearer tokens; tighten for production.

  Correctness/Robustness Notes

  - AuthService.check_email_exists infers existence by parsing Supabase error strings (backend/app/services/auth.py:19-52). Fragile and can break on API changes.
  - reset_password and sign_out use supabase.auth.set_session(...) in ways that may not align with latest client expectations; test with current supabase-py.
  - File size check reads entire file to memory (backend/app/routers/files.py:31-38). OK for 10MB cap, but streaming check would be more scalable.
  - Download endpoint authorization is good, but irrelevant if static mount stays.
  - Frontend transforms generated URLs to absolute, assuming backend base URL (frontend/src/lib/api.ts): OK.

  Recommended Fixes (Minimal, High-Impact)

  - Auth safety:
      - Implement real JWT verification using Supabase JWKS; fail closed on errors. Replace verify_signature=False (backend/app/services/auth.py:326).
      - Optionally, validate aud/iss and token expiry.
  - Remove public static mounts:
      - Delete or guard app.mount("/generated", ...) and app.mount("/uploads", ...) (backend/app/main.py:20-21). Serve downloads via /download/{filename} with auth.
  - Secrets hygiene:
      - Delete backend/.env and frontend/.env from VCS, add entries to .gitignore, rotate all exposed keys.
  - Startup/config:
      - Make Supabase optional for MVP: don’t raise in Settings.__init__ if using public endpoints; defer checks to auth-only code paths (backend/app/core/config.py:35-36).
      - Fix run instructions and scripts to use uvicorn app.main:app from backend/, or change start.py to uvicorn.run("app.main:app", ...).
      - Align ports: set FRONTEND_URL to http://localhost:8080 (or whatever Vite uses), update README accordingly.
  - Routing:
      - If MVP truly doesn’t require auth for uploads/generation, either add optional routes without Depends(get_current_user) or provide a guest auth path. Otherwise update README and UI to require login before upload.

  File Hotspots

  - Unsigned token decode: backend/app/services/auth.py:326
  - Public static exposure: backend/app/main.py:20, backend/app/main.py:21
  - Hard Supabase requirement: backend/app/core/config.py:35-36
  - Auth-required upload/generate: backend/app/routers/files.py:17, backend/app/routers/files.py:53, backend/app/routers/files.py:88, backend/app/routers/files.py:105
  - Vite port: frontend/vite.config.ts:9
  - Axios base URL: frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx:52
  - Committed secrets: backend/.env, frontend/.env
