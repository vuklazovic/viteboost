# ðŸ”— Stripe Payment Links Setup

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

Your subscription system now uses **Stripe Payment Links** instead of custom payment forms. This is much simpler, more secure, and requires minimal code maintenance.

## âœ… What's Already Done

âœ… **Backend**: Simplified subscription system with payment link support
âœ… **Frontend**: Updated to redirect to Stripe payment links
âœ… **Plans**: All 5 subscription tiers configured

## ðŸš€ Next Steps: Create Stripe Payment Links

### Step 1: Log into Stripe Dashboard

1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/)
2. Make sure you're in **Test mode** (for now)

### Step 2: Create Payment Links

Go to **Products** â†’ **Payment Links** â†’ **Create payment link**

#### Basic Plan ($12/month)
```
Product: VibeBoost Basic
Price: $12.00 USD
Recurring: Monthly
Description: 100 credits per month for individuals
```

#### Pro Plan ($39/month)
```

```

#### Business Plan ($89/month)
```

Price: $89.00 USD

```

### Step 3: Copy Payment Links

After creating each payment link, Stripe will give you URLs like:
```
https://buy.stripe.com/test_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### Step 4: Update Backend Configuration

Update the payment links in `/backend/app/routers/subscriptions_simple.py`:

```python
PAYMENT_LINKS = {
    "basic": "https://buy.stripe.com/test_your_actual_basic_link",
    "pro": "https://buy.stripe.com/test_your_actual_pro_link",
    "business": "https://buy.stripe.com/test_your_actual_business_link"
}
```

### Step 5: Configure Success/Cancel URLs

In each Stripe payment link, set:
- **Success URL**: `http://localhost:8082/subscription-success`
- **Cancel URL**: `http://localhost:8082/pricing`

## ðŸŽ¯ How It Works

### User Journey:
1. **User visits pricing page** â†’ Sees all subscription plans
2. **User clicks "Subscribe"** â†’ Redirected to Stripe payment link
3. **User completes payment** â†’ Stripe handles everything securely
4. **Payment succeeds** â†’ User redirected back to your app
5. **Webhook notification** â†’ Your backend updates user subscription

### Benefits:
âœ… **Security**: Stripe handles all payment data
âœ… **Compliance**: PCI compliance handled by Stripe
âœ… **Maintenance**: No complex payment forms to maintain
âœ… **Features**: Built-in tax handling, multiple payment methods
âœ… **Mobile**: Optimized for mobile payments

## ðŸ”§ Webhook Setup (Optional but Recommended)

To automatically update user subscriptions when payments succeed:

1. Go to **Developers** â†’ **Webhooks** in Stripe Dashboard
2. **Add endpoint**: `http://your-domain.com/subscriptions/webhook`
3. **Select events**:
   - `checkout.session.completed`
   - `customer.subscription.created`
   - `customer.subscription.updated`
   - `customer.subscription.deleted`

## ðŸ§ª Testing

### Test the Flow:
1. **Visit pricing page** â†’ `http://localhost:8082`
2. **Click subscription button** â†’ Should open Stripe payment link
3. **Use test card**: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
4. **Complete payment** â†’ Should redirect back to your app

### Test Cards:
- **Success**: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- **Decline**: `4000 0000 0000 0002`
- **3D Secure**: `4000 0025 0000 3155`

## ðŸŽ‰ Production Deployment

When ready for production:

1. **Switch to Live mode** in Stripe Dashboard
2. **Create live payment links** (same process)
3. **Update backend** with live payment links
4. **Update webhook endpoint** to production URL
5. **Test with real payment methods**

## ðŸ’¡ Additional Features

You can enhance the payment links with:
- **Custom fields** (collect additional info)
- **Promotional codes** (discount functionality)
- **Trial periods** (free trial before charging)
- **Multiple payment methods** (cards, bank transfers, etc.)

## ðŸ”— Current Configuration

Your system currently expects these payment links:
- **Basic**: `https://buy.stripe.com/test_your_basic_link`
- **Pro**: `https://buy.stripe.com/test_your_pro_link`
- **Business**: `https://buy.stripe.com/test_your_business_link`

Replace these with your actual Stripe payment links!
